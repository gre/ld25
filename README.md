Context
-------

This Game has been made in 48 hours for the contest: Ludum Dare 25 "You are the Villain".

This was my initial draft: https://twitter.com/greweb/status/279884502220812288

Technologies
------------

The game has been implemented in CSS & HTML Canvas (Javascript) with the help of these libraries: jQuery, Backbone.js (+Underscore.js), Illuminated.js.

I wish I had more time to finish it, I wanted to port the current basic collision system to a proper physic engine (using Box2d) and also to make the tongue behave like a "string" so it can be more realistic and fun. 

My main achievement in this project was to make the graphics with Inkscape (not being a designer, I'm proud of my monster and top-down walk sprites!).
